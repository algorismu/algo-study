# Algorithms & Data Structures (Self-Study)

This repository contains all algorithms and data structures that I have studied and implemented.

It serves as a two-fold purpose:

1 - A _reference_ of all algorithms & data structures I have encoutered and studied.

2 - Sharpen my _Scala 3_ language skills.

## Study References
- The Algorithm Design Manual, 3rd Edition - _Steven Skiena_

- Algorithms - _Jeff Erickson_

## Project Structure
This repo is a normal _sbt_ project that contains the implemented algorithms and data structures as libraries, thus you can try the code or spin some throw away _scala worksheets_ to test the libraries.
